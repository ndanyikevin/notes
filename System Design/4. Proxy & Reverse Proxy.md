## 🌐 What Is a Proxy?

A **proxy server** acts as an **intermediary** between a **client** and a **server**.  
It forwards requests and responses between them.

In simple terms:

> A **proxy** sits in the middle of communication between your device and the internet.

## 🧩 There Are Two Main Types

|Type|Who it serves|Common use|
|---|---|---|
|**Forward Proxy**|Serves the **client**|Hides the client’s identity, filters or monitors outgoing requests|
|**Reverse Proxy**|Serves the **server**|Protects and manages traffic coming **into** a server|

## 🧠 1. Forward Proxy (Client-side)

### Definition:

A **forward proxy** stands between the **client** and the **internet**.

It represents the **client** — the outside servers never see the real client IP.

### 🔁 Flow:

```
[Client] → [Forward Proxy] → [Internet/Server]
```

### 💡 Example Use Cases:

- Accessing blocked websites (proxy hides your IP)
    
- Company networks that monitor or filter employee web traffic
    
- Caching frequently accessed content for faster loading
    
- Anonymity and security
    

### 🌍 Example:

You use a proxy to browse Google:

1. You → send request to proxy.
    
2. Proxy → sends it to Google.
    
3. Google → responds to proxy.
    
4. Proxy → sends it back to you.
    

Google only sees the **proxy’s IP**, not yours.

## 🧠 2. Reverse Proxy (Server-side)

### Definition:

A **reverse proxy** sits in front of one or more **servers** and handles incoming requests **on their behalf**.

It represents the **server** — clients don’t directly talk to the backend servers.

### 🔁 Flow:

```
[Client] → [Reverse Proxy] → [Backend Servers]
```

### 💡 Example Use Cases:

- **Load balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
    
- **Security:** Hide real server IPs from attackers.
    
- **Caching:** Store common responses to improve speed.
    
- **SSL termination:** Handle HTTPS encryption/decryption.
    
- **Routing:** Direct requests to different services (like `/api` → API server, `/images` → image server).
    

### ⚙️ Example:

You visit `schoolapp.com`:

1. Browser → sends request to `schoolapp.com`.
    
2. The **reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or AWS ALB)** receives it.
    
3. It checks where to route it — maybe:
    
    - `/api` → Node.js backend
        
    - `/media` → S3 bucket
        
4. It forwards the request, gets the response, and sends it back to your browser.
    

Your browser never knows the actual backend server’s address.

## 🧱 Common Proxy Tools

|Tool|Typical Use|
|---|---|
|**Squid Proxy**|Forward proxy for caching or filtering|
|**Nginx**|Reverse proxy, load balancer, web server|
|**HAProxy**|Reverse proxy and high-performance load balancer|
|**Cloudflare**|Global reverse proxy for security and CDN|
|**AWS ALB / API Gateway**|Managed reverse proxies for AWS services|

## 🧮 Summary Table

|Feature|Forward Proxy|Reverse Proxy|
|---|---|---|
|Serves|Client|Server|
|Hides|Client’s identity|Server’s identity|
|Common Use|Security, anonymity, content filtering|Load balancing, caching, SSL termination|
|Example Tools|Squid, Privoxy|Nginx, HAProxy, Cloudflare|

## 🏫 Example in Your School Management System

Imagine:

- You have multiple backend microservices: `auth-service`, `student-service`, `teacher-service`
    
- You use **Nginx as a reverse proxy**
    

Requests flow like this:

```
[Mobile App]
   ↓
[Reverse Proxy (Nginx / API Gateway)]
   ↙             ↓             ↘
[Auth Service] [Student Service] [Teacher Service]
```

This setup improves **security**, **organization**, and **scalability**.
