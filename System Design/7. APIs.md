## ⚙️ What Is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

It’s a **set of rules** that allows **two software systems to communicate** with each other.

> In simple terms:  
> An **API** is like a **messenger** that carries requests from one program to another — and returns the responses.

## 🧩 Real-World Analogy

Think of an **API as a waiter in a restaurant** 🍽️

- You (the client) tell the waiter what you want — “I’d like some chapati and tea.”
    
- The waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server).
    
- The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter.
    
- The waiter brings it back to you.
    

You don’t go into the kitchen or see how the food is made —  
you just use the **menu** (API documentation) to know what you can ask for.

## 🧠 In Technical Terms

An API defines:

- **What you can ask for** (available endpoints)
    
- **How to ask for it** (HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT)
    
- **What you get back** (data format, usually JSON)

## 📡 Example: School Management System API

Let’s say you have a **backend** running on AWS, and a **React Native mobile app** used by teachers and students.

When a teacher logs in, your app might make an **API call** like this:

### Request:

```
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "teacher@school.com",
  "password": "mypassword123"
}
```

### Response:

```
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "name": "Mr. Kevin",
    "role": "Head of IT"
  }
}
```

That’s your API in action.

## 📦 Common API Types

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**REST API**|Uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE|`GET /students`|
|**GraphQL API**|Client defines exactly what data it needs|Query: `{ student(id: 1) { name, class } }`|
|**SOAP API**|Older XML-based format, used in enterprise systems|`<SOAP-ENV:Envelope>...</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>`|
|**WebSocket API**|For real-time communication|Live chat or notifications|
|**gRPC**|High-performance, binary-based API for microservices|Used in distributed systems|

---

## 🧮 REST API Example (Most Common)

|Method|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**GET**|Retrieve data|`/students` → get all students|
|**POST**|Add data|`/students` → add new student|
|**PUT**|Update data|`/students/7` → update student 7|
|**DELETE**|Remove data|`/students/7` → delete student 7|

Response is usually in **JSON**, which is easy for both humans and apps to read.

## 🔐 Why APIs Matter

1. **Connect frontend & backend** — your app can talk to your server.
    
2. **Integrate systems** — connect external services like payment gateways, email, or SMS.
    
3. **Enable automation** — systems can talk to each other without manual work.
    
4. **Scalability** — one API can serve many clients (mobile, web, IoT).
    
5. **Security** — APIs control what data can be accessed and how.

## 🧰 Examples in Everyday Life

|App|What the API Does|
|---|---|
|**Weather app**|Gets live weather data from weather API|
|**M-Pesa / PayPal**|Sends and verifies payments via payment APIs|
|**Google Maps**|Provides map data and directions|
|**Your school app**|Sends grades, attendance, or messages via your custom API|

## 🏗 In AWS Context

In AWS, APIs are often exposed through:

- **API Gateway** (handles requests, authentication, rate limiting)
    
- **Lambda functions** (process logic)
    
- **DynamoDB** (stores data)
    

Flow:

```
[Mobile App] → [API Gateway] → [Lambda Function] → [DynamoDB]
```

## 🧩 Summary

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**API**|A bridge that allows two systems to talk to each other|
|**REST API**|Common type using HTTP and JSON|
|**Endpoint**|A specific URL for an action (`/students`, `/login`)|
|**Request**|What the client sends|
|**Response**|What the server returns|
