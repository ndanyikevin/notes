## 🌐 What Is the Domain Name System (DNS)?

**DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**.  
It’s like the **phonebook of the internet** 📖 — it translates **human-friendly names** (like `google.com`) into **machine-friendly IP addresses** (like `142.250.190.78`).

Computers and servers communicate using **IP addresses**,  
but humans prefer **names** — so DNS connects the two.

## 🧠 In One Sentence:

> DNS converts a **domain name** into an **IP address**, allowing your browser or app to find the right server.

## 🏠 Real-World Analogy

Think of calling someone:

- You don’t remember everyone’s phone number.
    
- You just look up their **name** in your phone’s **contacts**.
    
- The phone automatically dials their **number**.
    

Similarly:

- You type `www.amazon.com` → DNS looks up the matching **IP address** → your device connects to that server.

## ⚙️ How DNS Works (Step-by-Step)

Let’s follow what happens when you visit `https://www.schoolapp.com`:

1. 🧑‍💻 **You type** `www.schoolapp.com` into your browser.
    
2. 🌍 **DNS Resolver** (usually provided by your ISP or Google DNS `8.8.8.8`) looks it up.
    
3. 🧩 **Recursive lookup** begins — it checks several servers:
    
    - **Root DNS Server** → knows where to find `.com` domains.
        
    - **TLD (Top-Level Domain) Server** → knows where `.com` domains are stored.
        
    - **Authoritative DNS Server** → holds the actual record for `schoolapp.com`.
        
4. 📦 The **authoritative server** returns the IP address, e.g., `15.160.24.5`.
    
5. 💨 Your browser caches it and connects directly to that IP to load the website.

## 🧩 DNS Record Types

|Record Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**A**|Maps a domain to an IPv4 address|`schoolapp.com → 15.160.24.5`|
|**AAAA**|Maps a domain to an IPv6 address|`schoolapp.com → 2406:da1:abcd::1`|
|**CNAME**|Alias for another domain|`www.schoolapp.com → schoolapp.com`|
|**MX**|Mail exchange (email servers)|Handles `@schoolapp.com` email|
|**TXT**|Stores text info (e.g., for verification or SPF records)|Security settings|
|**NS**|Lists the authoritative DNS servers|`ns1.aws.com`, `ns2.aws.com`|

---

## 🏗 Example in AWS

In AWS, you’d use **Route 53** (Amazon’s DNS service) to:

- Register your domain name (e.g., `schoolapp.com`)
    
- Create DNS records (like A, CNAME)
    
- Route traffic to your backend (EC2, S3, or Load Balancer)

## ⚡️ Why DNS Is Important in System Design

- Makes your system **user-friendly** (no one wants to type IPs 😅)
    
- Supports **load balancing** (multiple IPs for one domain)
    
- Enables **scalability** (easy to redirect traffic)
    
- Improves **reliability** (failover between servers)
    
- Allows integration with **CDNs**, **email services**, etc.

## 💡 Example Recap

|Action|What Happens|
|---|---|
|User opens `schoolapp.com`|Browser asks DNS for IP|
|DNS returns `15.160.24.5`|Browser connects to that server|
|Server sends web page|Browser displays it|
