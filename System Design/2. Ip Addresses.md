## 🌐 What Is an IP Address?

**IP address** stands for **Internet Protocol address**.  
It’s a **unique identifier** assigned to every device that connects to a network (like the Internet or your local Wi-Fi).

Think of it as a **digital “home address”** for your device.  
It tells other computers **where to send information**.

## 🏠 Real-World Analogy

Imagine sending a letter:

- You (the sender) write your address and the recipient’s address on the envelope.
    
- The post office uses those addresses to deliver the letter correctly.
    

Similarly:

- Your **computer** has an IP address.
    
- A **server** (like google.com) has an IP address.
    
- Data packets travel across the internet using those addresses to reach the right destination.

## 🔢 Two Main Types of IP Addresses

### 1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**

- The most common and older format.
    
- Looks like this:
    
    ```
    192.168.1.10
    ```
    
- Each number ranges from 0 to 255.
    
- Has about 4.3 billion unique addresses.
    

### 2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**

- Newer version — created because IPv4 addresses were running out.
    
- Looks like this:
    
    ```
    2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2
    ```
    
- Supports trillions of devices — used by modern networks (like 5G, IoT).

## 🧩 Two Categories Based on Scope

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Public IP**|Used on the Internet; unique worldwide|Your router’s IP assigned by your ISP|
|**Private IP**|Used inside local networks (home, office)|192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.5|
|**Loopback IP**|Refers to your own device|127.0.0.1 (localhost)|

## 🔄 How It Works (Simplified)

When you visit `https://example.com`:

1. Your device sends a request using your **IP address**.
    
2. The **DNS** (Domain Name System) converts the website name into the server’s **IP address**.
    
3. The request travels across the internet to that IP.
    
4. The server responds back to your IP.

## 💡 In System Design Context

- Every **client** and **server** in a client-server architecture uses IP addresses to communicate.
    
- AWS resources (like EC2, Load Balancers, etc.) all have IPs.
    
- When you access your school management system:
    
    - The **client app** connects to your **server’s IP address** (usually hidden behind a domain like `api.schoolapp.com`).
