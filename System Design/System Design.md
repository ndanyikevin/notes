## üß† What ‚ÄúSystem Design‚Äù Really Means

System design is **the process of defining the architecture, components, data flow, and technologies** needed to build a software system that meets specific requirements (performance, reliability, scalability, etc.).

Think of it as:

> ‚ÄúHow do we make this system work **well** ‚Äî not just **work**?‚Äù

## üß© The Core Concepts You Need to Understand First

Here‚Äôs a roadmap of the **core concepts** (we‚Äôll go step-by-step through each if you like):

### 1. **Requirements Gathering**

- Functional: What the system _does_ (e.g., ‚Äúteachers can record grades‚Äù).
    
- Non-functional: How the system _behaves_ (e.g., ‚Äúmust handle 1000 users,‚Äù ‚Äúmust recover in 1 minute after crash‚Äù).
    

### 2. **System Architecture**

- Monolithic vs Microservices
    
- Client‚ÄìServer
    
- Three-tier or N-tier architecture
    
- APIs and communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
    

### 3. **Data Design**

- Database choice (SQL vs NoSQL)
    
- Schema design
    
- Indexing, normalization, partitioning, replication
    

### 4. **Scalability**

- Vertical scaling vs Horizontal scaling
    
- Load balancing
    
- Caching (Redis, CDN)
    
- Database sharding
    

### 5. **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**

- Redundancy (multiple servers)
    
- Backups and failover
    
- Retry mechanisms
    
- Monitoring and alerting
    

### 6. **Security**

- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth, IAM)
    
- Encryption
    
- Network security (firewalls, VPC)
    
- Least privilege principles
    

### 7. **Performance Optimization**

- Caching
    
- Asynchronous processing (queues, workers)
    
- Database query optimization
    
- CDN for static assets
    

### 8. **Maintainability**

- Logging & monitoring
    
- CI/CD pipelines
    
- Documentation
    
- Modular code structure

## üèó Example: Designing a School Management System (SMS)

We can practice these concepts step-by-step. For example:

1. **Requirement:** Allow teachers to record grades.
    
2. **Architecture:** Mobile app (React Native) ‚Üí API (Node.js + AWS Lambda) ‚Üí Database (DynamoDB)
    
3. **Data Design:** Tables for Students, Teachers, Subjects, Grades
    
4. **Scalability:** API Gateway + Lambda (auto-scale)
    
5. **Security:** Cognito for user login
    
6. **Reliability:** DynamoDB streams for backups
    
7. **Monitoring:** CloudWatch metrics & alarms
