## ⚡️ What Is Latency?

**Latency** is the **time delay** between when a request is sent and when the response is received.

In other words:

> It’s how long it takes for data to **travel** from one point to another.

### 🕒 Simple Example

You click a button in your school management app to load students:

1. Your phone sends a request to the server.
    
2. The server processes it and sends data back.
    
3. You see the result appear.
    

If that entire round trip takes **200 milliseconds**,  
then the **latency = 200 ms**.

## 🔁 The Request–Response Timeline

```
You click ➜ Request sent ➜ Server receives ➜ Server processes ➜ Response sent ➜ You see result
                 ↑                                                ↓
              Latency measured here (round-trip time)
```

## 🧩 Components of Latency

1. **Network latency** — time it takes for data to travel across the network (e.g., from Nairobi to AWS data center).
    
2. **Processing latency** — time the server takes to process your request.
    
3. **Application latency** — time added by app logic or slow database queries.
    
4. **Disk latency** — delay when reading/writing to disk or database.
    

Total latency = network + processing + application + disk

## 📏 Common Units

Latency is usually measured in **milliseconds (ms)**.

|Latency|User Perception|
|---|---|
|1–50 ms|Feels instant|
|100–200 ms|Slight delay|
|300–1000 ms|Noticeable lag|
|>1000 ms|Feels slow or unresponsive|

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Imagine sending a text message:

- You send “Hi” to your friend.
    
- It takes 3 seconds for them to receive it.
    

That **3 seconds** is latency — the delay before the response is seen.

## 🧰 In System Design Context

Latency affects **user experience** and **system performance**.

|Layer|Example|Latency Source|
|---|---|---|
|**Frontend**|Browser rendering|Slow JavaScript or UI rendering|
|**Network**|Between client and server|Long physical distance or congestion|
|**Backend**|Server processing|Complex logic or slow database queries|
|**Database**|Query execution|Unoptimized queries, indexes missing|

---

## 🚀 How to Reduce Latency

1. **Use CDN** (Content Delivery Network) — bring content closer to users.
    
2. **Cache responses** (Redis, CloudFront).
    
3. **Optimize database queries**.
    
4. **Use load balancing** to prevent overloaded servers.
    
5. **Deploy servers closer to users** (choose nearby AWS regions).
    
6. **Compress data** to reduce transfer size.
    
7. **Use asynchronous processing** for slow tasks.

## 🏫 Example: In Your School App

Let’s say your app is hosted on AWS in the **US**, and students in **Kenya** are using it.

- Request travels from Kenya → US → back
    
- Distance adds **network latency** (maybe 300–400 ms)
    
- If your server also takes time to process data, total latency may reach 600 ms.
    

To fix that, you could:

- Move to an **AWS Africa region** (Cape Town)
    
- Add **caching** for frequent data (like student lists)
    
- Use a **CDN** for static files

## ⚙️ Key Difference: Latency vs Bandwidth

|Term|Meaning|Analogy|
|---|---|---|
|**Latency**|Delay before data starts moving|Time before water starts flowing after you open the tap|
|**Bandwidth**|Amount of data that can move per second|Size of the pipe (how much water flows at once)|
