### AWS Tags
---
**IAM tags** in AWS are **key–value labels** that you can attach to **IAM users, roles, and policies** to help you **organize, manage, and control access** more easily.

They’re just like tags on EC2 instances or S3 buckets — but for **identity resources**.

---

### 🧩 Example

Let’s say you have several IAM roles and users in your organization:

|IAM Entity|Tag Key|Tag Value|
|---|---|---|
|`DevRole`|`Department`|`Engineering`|
|`FinanceUser`|`Department`|`Finance`|
|`AdminRole`|`AccessLevel`|`Admin`|

---

### ⚙️ Why use IAM tags

#### 1. **Organization**

Tags help categorize your IAM entities — by department, project, cost center, or environment.

Example:

```bash
Key = Department
Value = Finance
```

#### 2. **Access control (Tag-based permissions)**

You can use **tags in IAM policies** to control access dynamically.

Example:  
Allow a user to manage roles only if they share the same department tag:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:PassRole",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceTag/Department": "${aws:PrincipalTag/Department}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures that users in **Engineering** can only pass **Engineering** roles.

#### 3. **Cost tracking & auditing**

Tags can be used in AWS **billing reports** and **AWS Config** to track identity usage or resource ownership.

---

### 💡 Supported IAM entities for tagging

- **Users**
    
- **Groups**
    
- **Roles**
    
- **Policies**
    

---

### 🧠 Key point

Tags are **metadata** — they **don’t grant permissions by themselves**, but they can be **used in IAM policies and AWS conditions** to make permissions more flexible and context-aware.

---

✅ **In short:**

> **IAM tags** are key–value labels you attach to IAM users, roles, or policies to help you **organize identities**, **control access dynamically**, and **track resources** across your AWS environment.



## Credentials Report
---
An **AWS IAM Credentials Report** is a **security report** that lists **all IAM users** in your AWS account and shows details about **their credentials and security status** — like passwords, access keys, and MFA settings.

It’s one of the key tools for **auditing IAM security**.

---

### 🧩 In simple terms:

Think of it as an **Excel-style summary** that answers:

> “Who has access to my AWS account, and how secure are their credentials?”

---

### 📊 What the report includes

Each row represents one IAM user and contains information such as:

|Column|Description|
|---|---|
|`user`|Username|
|`arn`|The user’s Amazon Resource Name|
|`user_creation_time`|When the IAM user was created|
|`password_enabled`|Whether the user has a console password|
|`password_last_used`|When the password was last used|
|`mfa_active`|Whether MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enabled|
|`access_key_1_active`|If the first access key is active|
|`access_key_1_last_used_date`|When that key was last used|
|`cert_1_active`|If an X.509 certificate is active (for old AWS services)|

---

### ⚙️ How to generate it

You can create or download the report via:

#### 🖥️ AWS Management Console

1. Go to **IAM → Access reports → Credential report**.
    
2. Click **Download Report (CSV)**.
    

#### 🧩 AWS CLI

```bash
aws iam generate-credential-report
aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 --decode
```

---

### 🧠 Why it’s useful

- **Security auditing** – Find inactive users, unused access keys, or missing MFA.
    
- **Compliance** – Required for standards like ISO 27001 or SOC 2.
    
- **Account hygiene** – Helps identify stale or risky credentials.
    

---

### ⚠️ Example insights you might find

- A user has an **active access key** that hasn’t been used in 180 days.
    
- Someone’s **password never expires**.
    
- A **root user** still doesn’t have **MFA** enabled.
    

---

✅ **In short:**

> The **IAM Credentials Report** is a downloadable security audit file showing the **status of all user credentials** in your AWS account — used to spot risks like inactive keys, missing MFA, or old passwords.



## Access Advisor
---
**IAM Access Advisor** in AWS is a tool that shows you **what services an IAM user, role, or group has access to — and when they last used each one.**

It helps you identify **unused permissions** so you can **tighten security** and follow the **principle of least privilege**.

---

### 🧩 In simple terms:

Access Advisor answers this question:

> “This IAM user or role _can_ access 30 services — but which ones have they actually used recently?”

---

### ⚙️ How it works

For each IAM entity (user, role, or group), AWS Access Advisor displays:

- The **list of AWS services** the entity has permissions for.
    
- The **last accessed time** for each service (e.g., “Used 15 days ago” or “Never accessed”).
    
- Whether that access comes from **attached policies** (AWS managed, customer managed, or inline).
    

You can view this data:

- In the **AWS Management Console** under IAM → Users/Roles → **Access Advisor** tab.
    
- Or via the **AWS CLI**:
    
    ```bash
    aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details --job-id <value>
    ```
    

---

### 💡 Example

Say you have a role `DataProcessorRole` that has access to:

|Service|Last Accessed|
|---|---|
|Amazon S3|3 days ago|
|DynamoDB|90 days ago|
|Lambda|Never accessed|

➡️ You might decide to **remove** DynamoDB and Lambda permissions since they aren’t used.

---

### 🧠 Why it’s useful

- **Security hardening** – Remove unnecessary permissions.
    
- **Auditing and compliance** – Prove you follow least privilege.
    
- **Optimization** – Simplify policies and reduce risk of accidental misuse.
    

---

### ⚠️ Note

Access Advisor only tracks **service-level access** (e.g., “used S3”) — it doesn’t show specific API calls or actions.  
For that, you’d use **AWS CloudTrail**.

---

✅ **In short:**

> **IAM Access Advisor** shows which AWS services a user or role has **actually used and when**, helping you safely remove **unused permissions** and strengthen your account’s security posture.



## Access Analyzer
---
**AWS IAM Access Analyzer** is a **security tool** that helps you **find and monitor resources that are shared outside your AWS account or organization** — for example, S3 buckets, IAM roles, or KMS keys that are publicly or cross-account accessible.

It’s all about **detecting unintended access** and enforcing **least privilege**.

---

### 🧩 In simple terms:

Access Analyzer answers:

> “Is anything in my AWS account accessible from outside — like another account, the public, or an external organization?”

---

### ⚙️ What it does

When you turn it on, Access Analyzer:

1. **Analyzes resource policies** (e.g., bucket policies, IAM trust policies).
    
2. **Finds resources** that grant access to:
    
    - Other AWS accounts
        
    - AWS Organizations
        
    - Public (everyone on the internet)
        
    - Federated users (like external IdPs)
        
3. **Generates findings** showing _who has access_ and _how_.
    

---

### 💡 Example Findings

|Resource|Finding|Risk|
|---|---|---|
|S3 Bucket|Accessible by `*` (public)|High|
|IAM Role|Trusted by external account `123456789012`|Medium|
|KMS Key|Shared with another org|Medium|

Each finding includes details and remediation steps.

---

### 🧠 Types of Analyzers

|Analyzer Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Account-level analyzer**|Monitors a single AWS account.|
|**Organization-level analyzer**|Monitors all accounts in your AWS Organization (centralized).|

---

### ⚙️ Integration with other tools

- **AWS Config** → Detects configuration drift and compliance violations.
    
- **Security Hub** → Collects Access Analyzer findings centrally.
    
- **IAM Policy Validation** → Warns you while writing overly permissive policies.
    

---

### 🧰 Example use case

You upload files to an S3 bucket and accidentally make it public.  
Access Analyzer automatically creates a **finding** alerting you that:

> “S3 bucket `my-data-bucket` is accessible by everyone.”

You can then **fix the bucket policy** and re-run the analyzer to confirm it’s private again.

---

✅ **In short:**

> **IAM Access Analyzer** automatically scans and reports **resources that are accessible from outside your AWS account**, helping you **prevent data leaks** and **enforce least-privilege access**.


## Switching Roles
---

**Switch Role** in AWS means **temporarily assuming a different IAM role** — usually one that has **different or higher permissions** — without having to log out or use another account.

It’s a secure way to **access multiple AWS accounts or environments** using **one main sign-in**.

### 🧩 In simple terms:

Think of it like **changing uniforms** — you stay the same person, but you take on **different permissions** while you wear that role.  
When you’re done, you **switch back** to your normal identity.

---

### 🧠 Common use cases

|Scenario|Description|
|---|---|
|**Multi-account access**|An admin logs in to the main account and switches to a role in a dev/test/prod account.|
|**Temporary admin rights**|A user assumes an admin role only when needed, reducing risk.|
|**Cross-account access**|You switch into a role that belongs to another AWS account that trusts your current one.|
|**Service roles**|AWS services (like EC2 or Lambda) assume roles to access resources securely.|

---

### ⚙️ How it works

1. Your IAM **user or role** has permission to call:
    
    ```json
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    ```
    
2. The **target role’s trust policy** allows your user or account to assume it.
    
3. You “switch” to that role — AWS gives you **temporary security credentials**.
    
4. You operate under the **new role’s permissions** until the session expires.
    

---

### 💡 Example

Let’s say Kevin logs in to the **Main Account**, but he needs to manage EC2 instances in the **Dev Account**.

- Dev Account has a role called `DevOpsAccessRole`.
    
- The role’s **trust policy** allows Kevin’s account to assume it.
    
- Kevin uses **“Switch Role”** in the AWS Console and enters:
    
    ```
    Account ID: 123456789012
    Role name: DevOpsAccessRole
    ```
    
- He’s now operating with **DevOps permissions** — safely and temporarily.
    

---

### 🔒 Benefits

- **No need for multiple logins**.
    
- **Improves security** (temporary credentials only).
    
- **Simplifies multi-account setups**.
    
- **Reduces risk** of long-term admin credentials.
    

---

✅ **In short:**

> **Switch Role** lets you temporarily take on another IAM role’s permissions — often across AWS accounts — for secure, flexible access without needing separate logins or permanent credentials.

Excellent follow-up 💪 — you’re now touching on how **cross-account role access** actually works in practice, using a **switch role URL**.

Let’s unpack that clearly 👇

---

## 🎯 Goal

You want to allow a **third-party AWS user** to access your AWS account (e.g., S3 bucket) by **switching roles** — without permanently giving them your credentials.

---

## 🧱 How It Works

### Step 1️⃣ — You Create a Role in Your Account

You create an **IAM role** (for example, `ThirdPartyAccessRole`) that:

- Has the **permissions** you want them to have (e.g., access to S3 bucket)
    
- Has a **trust policy** allowing their account or user to assume it
    

Example trust policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "unique-external-id"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Here,

- `444455556666` is the **third-party account ID**
    
- `ExternalId` is an optional **security measure** (helps prevent “confused deputy” attacks)
    

---

### Step 2️⃣ — You Generate the **Switch Role URL**

After you create the role, AWS lets you generate a URL that makes switching roles easy.

The URL format is:

```
https://signin.aws.amazon.com/switchrole?account=111122223333&roleName=ThirdPartyAccessRole&displayName=SharedAccess
```

Where:

- `account` = **Your AWS account ID**
    
- `roleName` = The **name of the IAM role**
    
- `displayName` = What will appear in their AWS console after switching
    

You share this **URL** with the third-party user.  
When they click it, they’ll be prompted to:

- Enter an optional **external ID** (if you required one)
    
- Then they’ll be switched into that role in **your AWS account** temporarily
    

---

### Step 3️⃣ — User Switches Role in AWS Console

From their own AWS Management Console:

- They click **Switch Role**
    
- Paste your **account ID** and **role name** (or use your generated URL)
    
- Optionally provide **external ID**
    
- Boom 💥 — they’re now temporarily operating in **your account**, but only with the permissions granted to that role
    

---

## ✅ Advantages

|Benefit|Description|
|---|---|
|**Secure**|No long-term credentials shared|
|**Temporary**|Role session expires automatically|
|**Scoped Access**|You define exactly what resources they can access|
|**Auditable**|All actions appear in CloudTrail under the assumed role|

---

## ⚠️ Important Tips

- Always use **external IDs** when sharing roles across organizations.
    
- You can also enforce **MFA** for assuming the role.
    
- Review **CloudTrail logs** to see what actions they perform.
    

---

### 🧩 Example Use Case

You’re giving a vendor or consultant temporary read access to your S3 bucket for analysis.  
They:

1. Log into their AWS console
    
2. Click your shared switch role URL
    
3. Instantly assume your role and get access to the bucket — no password exchange, no keys.
    

---

✅ **In summary:**

> You can safely share access to your AWS account by creating a role with specific permissions, allowing their account to assume it, and generating a **Switch Role URL** so they can easily log in under that role.
