### Elasticity
---
Means Matching resources to workload demand in real time.
- When traffic increases - the system add more servers or resources
- When traffic decreases - it releases unused resources to save cost

In AWS
Elasticity is built into many AWS services, for example.
1. EC2 Auto scaling. Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances.
2. Elastic Load Balancing - Distributes traffic across multiple instances.
3. Amazon Aurora (database) - Can automatically scale read replicas.
4. Serverless (Like AWS Lambda) - Scales functions up/down instantly.
Elasticity can be achieved in AWS by autoscaling. 
Elasticity is also known as horizontal scaling.

#### Auto scaling
---
Auto scaling automatically adjusts the number of computer resources (like EC2 instances, containers, etc) based on demand.
It ensures your app always has the right amount of capacity. Not too little (risk of downtime) and not too much (wasting money)

- Scale out - increasing/adding
- Scale in - decreasing/removing

### Scalability
---
Means the ability of a system to handle increasing (or decreasing) workload by adding or reducing resources - either automatically or manually.
It's about how well your system can grow with demand.
Scalability = capacity to expand (or shrink) resources to meet perfomance needs.

#### Types of Scalability
---
1. Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up/Down) Adding more power to a single machine. E.g upgrading an EC2 instance from t2.micro to m5.large (more CPU, RAM). Easy but limited on max hardware size.
2. Horizontal Scalability. (Scaling Out/In). Adding more machines to share load. E.g Running 10 EC2 instances behind a load balancer instead of just 1 big server. Preferred in cloud because it's flexible and fault- tolerant.
In AWS
- Vertical: Change instance type in EC2.
- Horizontal: Use Auto Scaling groups + Elastic Load Balancing.
- DBs like Amazon Auroro scale by adding replicas or storage.

#### Scalability vs Elasticity
Scalability is system's ability to handle growth (design capacity)
Elasticity - System automatically adds/removes resources in real time to match demand


### High Availability
---
Means designing your system so that it stays up and running with minimal downtime, even if part of the system fails.
High Availability = system is continously operational for long periods, despite failures.
The period of time the service is available to the customer is called High Availability(HA)
The period of time the service is NOT available to the customer is called Downtime.
HA is always measured in percentage.
High availability is achieved by  redundancy, failover and fault tolerance.

#### Key Principles if High Availability.
---
- Redundancy - Duplicate critical components eg multiple servers, multiple dbs.
- Failover - If one resource fails, traffic automatically shifts to another.
- Fault tolerance - system continues to work properly even when hardware/software fails.
- Geographic distribution - Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) ro Regions.
##### Services that Support HA by Design
---
- Elastic Load Balancing(ELB) - spreads traffic across healthy instances.
- Amazon RDS Multi - AZ -> Keeps a standby database replica in another AZ
- Route 53 - DNS failover across regions
- S3 - Data is automatically replicated across multiple facilities.
