### EFS (Elastic File System)
---
Is a fully managed. scalable, shared file storage service.
EFS is fully managed by AWS. You only need to mount to all the EC2 instances.
EFS is only for Linux EC2 instances
EFS works with NFSv4 Protocol
EFS is file based storage.
Think of it like a network drive that many instances (or other services) can connect to at the same time.
##### Key Points
- Shared storage. Multiple EC2 instances, containers, or even on-premises servers can access the same files concurrently.




### Snow Family
---
Snowf Family is used to transfer huge data from on-premise to AWS and vice versa.
SnowFamily is a physical data transfer using devices.

- SnowCone - supports upto 8TB
- SnowEdge - supports upto 100TB
- SnowMobile - PBs of Data

Snowfamily is used to transfer huge data from on-premise to  AWS and vice-versa
SnowFamily is a physical data transfer using devices.

#### Typical Use Cases:
- Data Migration from on-premises to AWS
- Disaster recovery (offline backup)
- Edge computing in remote areas with limited internet.
- Military or industrial environments where cloud connectivity is unreliable.


### Glacier
---
Is a low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backups.
Ideal for data you rarely access but need to keep for months or years.

##### Key points
- Very cheap - much lower cost than regular S3 storage.
- For infrequent access - meant for backups, archives, or compliance data.
- Retrieval takes time. Accessing files can take minutes to hours, depending on the retrieval option.
- Durable - Data is stored redundantly across multiple AZs
- Integrated with S3


### Storage Gateway
---
Is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your on-premises environment (like your local data center or office to AWS cloud storage)
In simple terms it acts as a bridge between your local storage and AWS - letting you use AWS storage as if it were part of your local network.

##### Key Idea:
It lets your existing servers and applications store data in AWS without needing to change how they work.


#### Types of Storage Gateways:
1. File Gateway.
	- Lets you store files in Amazon S3 using std file protocols like NFS or SMB
	- Looks like a local file share, but files are actually stored in the cloud.
	- Ideal for backups or archiving
2. Volume Gateway
     - Presents cloud-backed block storage volumes to your on-prem servers.
     - Snapshots are stored in Amazon EBS or S3
     - Great for disaster recovery
3. Tape Gateway
	 - Replaces physical backup tapes with virtual tapes stored in S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.
	 - Works with existing backup software.
	 - Used for long-term backup and archiving.

### Database Services.
---
RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
Issues of installing Physical DB
- No HA
- No elasticity
- Scalability issues
- Perfomance issues
- Security issues
- DB crash
- Storage issues
- Network issues
- Management issues
- Replication issues
- Upgrade issues
- Mirroring Issues
- Login issues
- Data issues
- Maintanance issues
- Integrity issues
- Cost issues


### AWS RDS(Relational Database Service)
---
AWS RDS is a managed database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational dbs in the cloud - without managing the db servers yourself.

#### Key Features
- Fully managed - AWS handles backups, patching, scaling, and replication.
- High availability - With Multi-AZ deployments, your database automatically fails over if one zone goes down.
- Scalable - You can increase storage or compute power with just a few clicks.
- Secure - supports encryption, IAM and VPC integration.
- Automated backups & monitoring built in.


#### Supported Database Engines(MOMPMA)
- Amazon Aurora (AWS's own high-perfomance engine)
- MySQL - open source
- PostgreSQL - open source
- MariaDB - community based
- Oracle - oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server

Ex: Instead of installing and maintaining MySQL on an EC2 instance, you create an RDS MySQL instance - AWS provisions the database, sets up networking, manages backups, and keeps it running. You just connect your app and start using it.


### AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
---

Is a tool that helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely with minimal downtime
In short move your data from one database to another, easily and safely.
#### Key features
- Supports many db types - You can migrate from or to: RS, Aurora, EC2 dbs, or on-premises dbs. Engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle , SQL server, MongoDB, etc
- Continous replication - Keeps source and target dbs in sync during migration
- Low downtime - Your application keeps running while data is copied.
- Secure - Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

#### Types of Migrations
- Homogenours Migration - same engines
- Heterogenous Migration - different engines



### DynamoDB
---
It's NoSQL db service in AWS.
It's AWS's fast, serverless database for key-value and document

#### Key Features
- NoSQL - stores data as key-value pair or JSON-like documents (not tables with rows/columns like SQL)
- Fully managed - No servers to manage. AWS handles scaling, backups, and perfomance.
- High perfomance - Single digit ms response times. even at massive scale.
- Auto-scaling - Automatically adjusts read/write capacity as your app grows.
- Highly available - Data is automatically replicated across multiple AZs
- Secure - Supports encryption, IAM and fine-grained access control.

#### Common use cases
- Real-time apps (gaming, IoT,chat)
- E-commerce shopping carts.
- Session or user profile storage.
- Caching and analytics.


### Redshift
---
Is a fully managed data warehouse service in AWS
It's AWS's fast, scalable db for analytics and reporting designed to handle large amounts of data (TBs to PBs)
#### Key Features
 - Data warehouse - Stores structured data for analysis, not for day-to-day transactions
 - Optimized for queries - Runs complex SQL queries across massive datasets very quickly.
 - Columnar storage - Data is stored by column (not row), which speeds up analytical queries.
 - Massively Parallel Processing(MPP) - Splits large queries across multiple nodes for high perfomance.
 - Integrates easily - Works with S3, AWS Glue, QuickSight, and other analytics tools.
 - Scalable - You can resize clusters as your data grows.

### AWS ElastiCache
---
Is a managed in-memory caching service in AWS
It helps speed up your apps by storing frequently accessed data in memory (RAM) instead of fetching it repeatedly from slower dbs like RDS or DynamoDB

##### Support Engines
- Redis - advanced caching, pub/sub messaging. leaderboards, session storage.
- Memcached - simple fast cache for frequently requested data.
