## Setting up Upstash account

**Upstash** is a **serverless data platform** that provides managed **Redis**, **Kafka**, and **QStash** (a serverless message queue) with a focus on **serverless and edge computing**.

---

### üîπ Core Features of Upstash

#### 1. **Serverless Redis**

- Fully managed Redis database with:
    
    - **REST API** and **Redis protocol (TCP)** support.
        
    - **Per-request pricing** (no need to keep instances always on).
        
    - **Global replication** for fast edge access.
        
    - Suitable for **Vercel**, **Cloudflare Workers**, **AWS Lambda**, and similar platforms.
        

#### 2. **Serverless Kafka**

- Managed Kafka for streaming events and logs.
    
- Designed to work seamlessly with **microservices** and **edge functions**.
    
- Offers **RESTful APIs** for simplified interaction.
    

#### 3. **QStash**

- A **serverless task/message queue** for delayed or scheduled task execution.
    
- Can be used to **send messages from your app to an API endpoint**, even with retries, delays, and rate limits.
    
- Ideal for background jobs or delayed tasks in serverless apps.

### üîπ Key Benefits

- **Pay-per-request pricing**: Optimized for unpredictable or low-throughput workloads.
    
- **Global low-latency** access.
    
- **Simple APIs** with both REST and native SDKs.
    
- Easy integration with serverless platforms like:
    
    - **Vercel**
        
    - **Cloudflare Workers**
        
    - **Next.js Edge Functions**
        
    - **AWS Lambda**
        

---

### üîπ Use Cases

- Caching with Redis in edge/serverless apps.
    
- Event streaming with Kafka in microservice architecture.
    
- Background task execution (e.g., send email reminders, retries) with QStash.
    
- Rate limiting, session storage, and pub/sub.

### üîπ Example: Using Redis with Upstash in Next.js

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const redis = new Redis({
  url: "https://your-upstash-url.upstash.io",
  token: "your-upstash-token",
});

export async function handler(req, res) {
  await redis.set("visits", 1);
  const visits = await redis.get("visits");
  res.json({ visits });
}
```

## ‚úàÔ∏è What Is Arcjet?

**Arcjet** is a **security-as-code** platform that enables you to add threat protection‚Äîbot detection, rate limits, email validation, WAF shields, PII redaction‚Äî**directly in your application‚Äôs code** ([arcjet.com](https://arcjet.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Arcjet - Security as code")).

- It uses an **SDK + lightweight middleware** running locally (via WebAssembly) to analyze and enforce rules in real time ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).
    
- When deeper analysis is needed (e.g., rate limit tracking or bot intelligence), Arcjet asynchronously calls its cloud API‚Äîtypically within **1ms to 20‚Äì30ms latency** .

## üîß Core Primitives

You decide which protections to apply in code‚Äîmix and match as needed :

- **Shield WAF** ‚Äì blocks SQL injection, XSS, and OWASP-style attacks
    
- **Rate Limiting** ‚Äì enforces request quotas (token bucket, etc.) with serverless state management
    
- **Bot Protection** ‚Äì identifies real bots vs. malicious actors
    
- **Email Validation** ‚Äì filters fake/disposable email signups
    
- **Sensitive Info Protection** ‚Äì blocks or redacts PII before it hits your system

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

1. **Middleware-based execution** in your app ensures full context and zero blind spots ([github.com](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Arcjet JS SDKs. Bot detection, rate limiting, email validation ... - GitHub"), [docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).
    
2. **Local processing** (WASM) handles simple rules immediately and reports back asynchronously ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).
    
3. **Cloud API coordination** manages stateful protections like rate limits and bot reputation ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).
    
4. **Fail-open default** ensures app availability even if Arcjet‚Äôs API is temporarily unreachable, though you can configure fail-closed ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).

## üß™ Use Cases & Developer Experience

- **Code alongside your logic** and version-control security rules: they‚Äôre part of your repo, not hidden in a firewall ([docs.next-forge.com](https://docs.next-forge.com/packages/security/application?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application Security - next-forge docs")).
    
- **Local and CI/CD testing** ensures rules behave predictably before production deployment ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).
    
- SDKs support modern stacks‚ÄîNode.js, Next.js, Deno, Bun, SvelteKit, NestJS, Remix, and integrations for Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify, etc. ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/get-started/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Get started with Arcjet")).

## ‚úîÔ∏è Why Choose Arcjet?

- **Developer-first**: easy to integrate (few lines of code), excellent docs, open-source SDKs ([linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/arcjet-security-code-aditya-upaganlawar-fgkyf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Arcjet- Security as code - LinkedIn")).
    
- **Performance-focused**: minimal latency, local-first analysis, often sub‚Äë1‚ÄØms ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).
    
- **Context-rich**: unlike external CDNs, Arcjet sees full request state so it can reduce false positives/negatives ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs")).
    
- **Modular**: choose only the protections you need, from bots to PII protection.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install** via NPM (Node.js):
    
    ```bash
    npm install @arcjet/node
    ```
    
2. **Initialize** in your app:
    
    ```js
    import arcjet from "@arcjet/node";
    const aj = arcjet({ key: process.env.ARCJET_KEY, rules: [ ‚Ä¶ ] });
    ```
    
3. **Define security rules** next to endpoints (rate ceilings, shield logic, etc.).
    
4. **Run locally** and in CI‚ÄîArcjet allows dev-time testing before production ([docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture | Arcjet Docs"), [dev.to](https://dev.to/rohan_sharma/secure-your-app-in-a-few-lines-of-code-using-arcjet-2cbb?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Secure your app in just a few lines of code using Arcjet! ‚úàÔ∏è"), [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/arcjet-security-code-aditya-upaganlawar-fgkyf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Arcjet- Security as code - LinkedIn")).
