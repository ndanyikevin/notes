## Psychological
***
You have an edge but
* You can't execute properly.
* You keep moving stop
* Late Entry
* Let losers run past stop.
* Don't have a stop
* Can't be patient. Take random trades out of boredom.

1. Focus on executing your rules perfectly over 10 or 20 trades
### Effects of focusing on 10 trades ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†
***

* Forces you to think in probabilities
* Forces you into  a process orientated mindset rather than outcome
* If you mess up so be it, keep going till you can execute perfectly then do it again and again, this is how you become consistent. You add more energy to a belief system that thinks in probabilities until there's no errors in your trading.
